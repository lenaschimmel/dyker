**Balance building a dyke and pushing your economy to earn enough resources before everything is flooded**

A mouse-controlled, small but somewhat complex game of dyke building and economy, with some card game mechanics sprinkled on top. The approaching flood wave might frighten you, but you may keep your calm, because time only passes while you are moving or working.

The game is controlled with the mouse pointer, using only the primary mouse key. You might need the ESC key to quit the game.

Explore the UI. Many elements show a description at the top of the screen.

In each level, you need to earn a specific amount of money before the flood crushes your insland, your economy or even you. If you feel hopeless, you may restart the level with the icon at the top right.
