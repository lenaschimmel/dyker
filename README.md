## DYKER

![Title image](misc/dyker.png)

**Balance building a dyke and pushing your economy to earn enough resources before everything is flooded**

A mouse-controlled, small but somewhat complex game of dyke building and economy, with some card game mechanics sprinkled on top. The approaching flood wave might frighten you, but you may keep your calm, because time only passes while you are moving or working.

## Instructions
Download the matching game for your platform. A web version will be uploaded soon. This game was created using [TIC-80](http://tic80.com/), and if you have any trouble running it, general TIC-80 advice applies. 

The game is entirely controlled with the mouse pointer, using only the primary mouse key. You might need the ESC key to quit the game.

Take your time to explore the UI. Many elements show a description at the top of the screen.

In each level, you need to earn a specific amount of money before the flood crushes your insland, your economy or even you. If you feel hopeless, you may restart the level with the icon at the top right.

## Sister game
This game was created under the roof of Pistacchio Studios, based on the same idea as its sister game [Shepherd's Island](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/shepherds-island) by @flauschzelle and @blinry. We decided that we wanted to explore different executions of that idea and wrote to games which share nothing but the same basic concept and the programming language (lua).
